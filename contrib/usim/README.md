# usim

An mc6809 emulator written in C++

NB: version 0.91 is historic (written in 1993!) and has some serious
known bugs in the handling of some instructions and addressing modes.
Many thanks are due to B. Armstrong and Soren Roug for finding and
resolving those.

The master branch on the primary Github repository
(https://github.com/raybellis/usim/) now contains fixes for those
issues.

## TODO

- Interrupt handling (inc. `SYNC` and `CWAI` instructions)
- many other things I probably didn't think of yet
